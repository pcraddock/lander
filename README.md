# python-lander
An educational physics game based on the BBC Micro game "Lander".

Requires Pygame - tested on Windows by installing Anaconda then running `conda install -c cogsci pygame=1.9.2a0` from a command line. Run by opening a terminal/command line, navigating to main, and starting the launcher using "python launcher.py".

Tested on Mac - it doesn't work ![thumbs up](http://pix.iemoji.com/phan33/0474.png).

Also, the videos are too large to upload to Github (although it shouldn't be...) so in order to run it you have to download each one independently (or eventually from a zipped archive). Since we don't have the actual videos yet you can use [this one as a placeholder](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2_EiDYUhSXpblJXSkhUVHZrc3c/view?usp=sharing).
